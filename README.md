# Hi there, I'm Tileni Hango 👋

Hello! I'm Tileni Hango, a third-year computer science student at the Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST). I'm an aspiring software developer interested in the backend, although I've also dabbled in full-stack projects. I have a knack for learning quickly and am always eager to explore new technologies. I enjoy building projects that help me expand my skill set with the help of YouTube.

## 🤖 Currently Crafting: Virtual Companion Chatbot with Journaling

As a big sister, I'm deeply invested in my little sister's well-being. With her navigating the challenges of teenagehood and depression, and the added distance as she's currently in Russia while I'm in Namibia, I wanted to create something to support her.

This project is my attempt to build a virtual companion chatbot that doubles as a safe space for journaling. Here's the vision:

**Features:**

- **Conversational AI:** Engaging chatbot powered by the OpenAI GPT API.
- **Mental Health Check-ins:** Gentle prompts to gauge her emotional state.
- **Journaling:** A secure, private haven for her thoughts and feelings.
- **Activities and Games:** Lighthearted interactions to lift her spirits.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Django (Python)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB 
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth or Django's built-in authentication
- **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend), Heroku (backend)


This project is more than just code; it's a bridge across continents, a testament to the power of technology to connect and care.
